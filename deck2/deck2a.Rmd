## 内容提纲

- 为什么要关心可复制性问题
- 如何实现数据分析的可复制性


本PPT的内容在Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel的[课件](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/sta112_f15)基础上修改而成。


# 为什么要重视可复制性问题(Reproducibility)?

## 《Science》 不经LaCour同意撤稿

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months ago.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study 
quickly discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## 《Seizure study》在作者要求下撤稿

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in 
Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After 
carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified 
that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published 
results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical 
correctness."*

## 数据表合并错误差点让文章被毙

- The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other 
survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the 
identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set 
in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results 
reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## 数据分析的可复制性

- 用代码完成数据分析 $\rightarrow$ R

- 让代码可读性提高 $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

- 版本控制 $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## 代码的可读性与文化学编程

**Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"**

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer- what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings- what we 
want a computer to do."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools


## 可复制性核查项目

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?


## 工具箱(Toolkit)

</center>

# Demo

## GitHub的注册和使用

- 注册GitHub账户 https://github.com/
    - This will be a public account associated with your name
    - Choose a username wisely for future use
    - Don't worry about details, you can fill them in later
    
- 创建一个版本库(repository) `intro_demo` 
    - Give a brief and informative description
    - Choose "Public"
    - Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README"
    - Click "Create Repository"

## 克隆一个版本库(repository)

- 进入 RStudio

- 通过File -> New Project
    - Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control 
    repository
    - Git: Clone a project from a repository
    - Fill in the info:
        - URL: use HTTPS address
        - project directory name: 可以创建一个本地文件夹
        - Create as a subdirectory of: 选择上述文件夹放在本地什么地方
        
- 注意: 每个任务或者项目应该有自己的版本库，都放在上述文件夹中.

## 冲突的合并

- 在GitHub的web端你可以编辑README文件并且`Commit` ，写上简单的描述.

- 之后, 在RStudio中同样编辑README文件with a different change.
    - Commit your changes
    - Try to push -- you'll get an error!
    - Try pulling
    - Resolve the merge conflict and then commit and push
    
- As you work in teams you will run into merge conflicts, learning how
to resolve them properly will be very important.


# Documenting and reporting

## R Markdown 

- Fully reproducible reports

- Simple markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks

**Tip:** Keep the Markdown cheat sheet handy, we'll refer to it often
as the course progresses.

[Live demo -- follow along]

# On to data analysis

## Task

Visualize relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in
2007 in countries. Also make a plot 

## Step 0: Load necessary packages

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include 
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use `dplyr` (for data wrangling) and 
`ggplot2` (for visualization) packages.

- Load these packages in your markdown file

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 1: Load data

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/gapminder.csv")
```

## Step 2: Subset data

- Start with the `gapminder` dataset

- Filter for cases (rows) where year is equal to 2007

- Save this new subsetted dataset as `gap07`

```{r}
gap07 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```


## Step 2: Explore and visualize

**Task:** Visualize the relationship between `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp`.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, data = gap07)
```

## Step 3: Dig deeper

**Task:** Color the points by continent.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, data = gap07)
```

## Step 3: Commit and push all changes

- Stage

- Commit (with a message)

- Push

# What's next?

## Update your analysis

What if you wanted to now change your analysis 

- to subset for 1952

- plot life expectancy (`lifeExp`) vs. population (`pop`)

- and size the points by GPD (`gpdPercap`)
    - hint: add argument `size = gpdPercap` to your plotting code

Once you're done, commit and push all your changes with a meaningful
message.
