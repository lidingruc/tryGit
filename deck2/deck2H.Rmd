## Today's agenda

- Introduction to tools for reproducible data analysis

# Reproducibility: who cares?

## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author LaCour

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months ago.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study 
quickly discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in 
Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After 
carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified 
that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published 
results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical 
correctness."*

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other 
survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the 
identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set 
in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results 
reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

# Reproducibility: why should we care?

## Two-pronged approach

<div class="columns-2">
\#1 
Convince researchers to adopt a reproducible research workflow

<br><br>

\#2
Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow

![two prongs](two-pronged-fork.jpg)

</div>

## Reproducible data analysis

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

- Literate programming $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# Scripting and literate programming 

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer- what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings- what we 
want a computer to do."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools


## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

# Toolkit

## Toolkit

<center>
![toolkit](toolkit.png)
</center>

# Demo

## Logging on to RStudio

- Go to gort.stat.duke.edu:8787

- Log on with your Net ID and password

## Live R/RStudio demo

- R as a calculator

```{r}
2 + 2
factorial(20)
```

- Working with variables

```{r}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

## Working with GitHub

- Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/
    - This will be a public account associated with your name
    - Choose a username wisely for future use
    - Don't worry about details, you can fill them in later
    
- Create a repository called `intro_demo` 
    - Give a brief and informative description
    - Choose "Public"
    - Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README"
    - Click "Create Repository"

## Cloning the repository

- Go to RStudio

- File -> New Project
    - Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control 
    repository
    - Git: Clone a project from a repository
    - Fill in the info:
        - URL: use HTTPS address
        - Create as a subdirectory of: Browse and create a new folder 
        call sta112
        
- Note for the future: Each course component you work on (an application 
exercise, a homework assignment, project, exam, etc.) should be its own 
repository, and should be fully contained in a folder inside the folder 
`sta112`.

## Merge conflicts

- On GitHub (on the web) edit the README document and `Commit` it with a 
message describing what you did.

- Then, in RStudio also edit the README document with a different change.
    - Commit your changes
    - Try to push -- you'll get an error!
    - Try pulling
    - Resolve the merge conflict and then commit and push
    
- As you work in teams you will run into merge conflicts, learning how
to resolve them properly will be very important.


# Documenting and reporting

## R Markdown 

- Fully reproducible reports

- Simple markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks

**Tip:** Keep the Markdown cheat sheet handy, we'll refer to it often
as the course progresses.

[Live demo -- follow along]

# On to data analysis

## Task

Visualize relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in
2007 in countries. Also make a plot 

## Step 0: Load necessary packages

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include 
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use `dplyr` (for data wrangling) and 
`ggplot2` (for visualization) packages.

- Load these packages in your markdown file

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 1: Load data

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/gapminder.csv")
```

## Step 2: Subset data

- Start with the `gapminder` dataset

- Filter for cases (rows) where year is equal to 2007

- Save this new subsetted dataset as `gap07`

```{r}
gap07 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```


## Step 2: Explore and visualize

**Task:** Visualize the relationship between `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp`.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, data = gap07)
```

## Step 3: Dig deeper

**Task:** Color the points by continent.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, data = gap07)
```

## Step 3: Commit and push all changes

- Stage

- Commit (with a message)

- Push

# What's next?

## Update your analysis

What if you wanted to now change your analysis 

- to subset for 1952

- plot life expectancy (`lifeExp`) vs. population (`pop`)

- and size the points by GPD (`gpdPercap`)
    - hint: add argument `size = gpdPercap` to your plotting code

Once you're done, commit and push all your changes with a meaningful
message.
